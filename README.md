# Check Equality of two String 

#### This is a very simple project to print out if two strings are equal or not without using the java.util.Objects. Otherwise, Objects.equals(stringa, stringb) could do the same thing.  


## Project Details & Use Cases
##### Implement checkEquals method that takes two string :

*	Return True if both strings are null
*   Return False if only one of them is null
*   Otherwise check if they are equal or not
